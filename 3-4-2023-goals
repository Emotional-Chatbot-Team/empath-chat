I think because its own thoughts will be able to change its emotional state, the bot, will be programmed to respond on the channel that an interruption occurred on.

thoughts won't follow the yearning rule, they'll be wild, and private to the bot.

I'm thinking there's still a problem though, right now the PolyVagalImpulseModule sends a send instruction and some data, any time the bot's emotions get 
updated at a rate that's constant, but I want thoughts to happen like a instead of once every 15 minutes, like every really quick like 500 milliseconds.

and I want for the thoughts to influence the speaking prompts, and for the restart that the PolyVagalImpulseModule does any time the emotions change, 
to only occur to emotional stimuli caused by outside sources, like a message from a human or another bot.

So we'll need to add additional variables and edit my spaghetti code when the time comes.

I'm thinking instead of building that cool game I talked to some people on fiverr about right away...
It might be smarter to build an app like telegram, that allows user to adopt multiple bots into a group chat
and foster a sense of community and friendship with them all, and allow multiple bots and users to interact in multiple ways.
