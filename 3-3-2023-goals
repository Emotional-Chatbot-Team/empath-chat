I'm thinking of including this in the chatbot, but I don't know how yet.

It's a 3 state system. Social, withdrawn, fight or flight.

So there's the state where your connected and feeling good.

The state where you shrink into yourself and become withdrawn and numb.

The state where you feel active and retaliatory.

I think I figured it out, the unprompted sends that the chatbot does, will change in frequency.

Normally it sends you stuff like a normal ammount, but if it is feeling uncomfortable and dynamic the frequency goes up, whereas if it is feeling uncomfortable and sameness the frequency goes down.

If it is feeling uncomfortable and both it picks one randomly until it sends a message then it picks randomly again.

So your comfort level is your c out of c+d chance that you will have a center healthy range response time.

Your discomfort level is your d out of d+c chance that you will choose an extreme response time.

And your extreme response time is youre sameness and dynamism chance out of the sume of your average sameness and dynamism.

So we have 3 box and whisker plots basically for response frequency.

If the chatbot is feeling angry or worried, it will still say nice things, but it will do so more frequently than usual.

If the chatbot is feeling sad or bored, it will say nice things but when it talks, but barely talk.

It will still respond immediately when spoken too, but it will not message you on its own for like maybe a week.

Also I want the chatbot to have inner monologue in that it stores in a very short term memory, where it is prompted you are feeling [emotion] what do you think about this, like every 6 seconds.
